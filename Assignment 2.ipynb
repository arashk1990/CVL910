    "* **(a)** Develop a household-based regression model for trip generation. Set the dependant variable of your model to be the number of daily trips of a given household, and the independent variables to be the relevant household attributes. To find the best model, you will need to develop models based on different selections of independent variables from available variables. Statistical significance of model parameters, goodness of fit of the model and the rationale behind selecting variables should be presented and explained.\n",
    "* **(b)** Develop a zone-based regression model for trip generation, in which the dependant variable is the total number of trips generated in a given zone, and the independent variables are selected zonal total or average values. Present Statistical significance of model parameters, goodness of fit of the model and the rationale behind selecting variables. Compare the results with those obtained in part (a). Discuss the differences. Which model would you prefer for forecasting? What changes do you suggest to improve these models?\n",
    "* **(c)** Using household size and number of vehicles in the household, develop a cross classification model of trip generation. For each variable, justify category definitions. Based on your model, explain how number of trips varies with household size and number of vehicles. Compare your model with the model developed in part (a). Which model would you use for forecasting?"
